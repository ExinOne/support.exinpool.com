title: Reserves Plan
---
In the world of digital assets, time is money. We understand that waiting to join or exit a node in the staking process could mean missing out on valuable opportunities. Therefore, to greatly enhance your staking experience, ExinPool has specially introduced the "Reserve Fund Plan" for SOL and DOT.

#### Why the Reserve Fund Plan?

ExinPool guarantees that all node assets are 100% staked on-chain, ensuring asset security and transparency. However, this also means that joining or exiting a node requires a certain processing time:

- DOT: Joining takes about 2 days to take effect, exiting requires up to 21 days.
- SOL: It takes about 3 days to take effect whether joining or exiting.

Although this is a common aspect of blockchain technology, we believe we can offer you a better experience.

#### How Does the Reserve Fund Plan Work?

To optimize your experience with joining and exiting ExinPool nodes, we have launched the Reserve Fund Plan. The core of this plan is to use ExinPool's own SOL and DOT as immediately available reserve funds. When you wish to join or exit a node, we aim to meet your needs as much as possible, significantly reducing your waiting time.

- Accelerated Joining: When you're in the queue to join a node, and ExinPool has sufficient reserve funds within the node, these funds will be prioritized for withdrawal to allow you to join swiftly, reducing wait times.
- Quick Exit: Similarly, when you're in the queue to exit a node, we will use reserve funds to take your place in the node, allowing you to immediately complete the exit without enduring the standard waiting period.

By implementing the Reserve Fund Plan, ExinPool aims to significantly enhance the convenience of joining and exiting nodes, while ensuring you enjoy all the benefits of on-chain staking, including high earnings and transparency. We believe this innovative service will greatly improve your staking experience, making asset management more flexible and efficient.

Please note, due to funding limits, large transactions may still require waiting. Rest assured, we are actively working to increase the size of the reserve fund to further optimize your experience.
