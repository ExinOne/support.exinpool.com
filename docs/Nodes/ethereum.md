> Q: Why is My Share still 0 after I successfully joined?

A：Because no revenue has been generated yet. There are 3 data displayed in My page: My shares, In the queue, Joined not valid.

* My shares: Current shares that have been successfully joined and are generating revenue.
* In the queue: Shares that are currently in the queue.
* Joined not valid: Shares that have been successfully joined but have not yet generated revenue.

> Q: Is there any revenue during queuing?

Not at the moment.

> Q: When will I start to earn after joining the node?

A: After successfully joining, revenue will be generated after the snapshot at 8:00 am Beijing time the next day.

> Q: How much does it cost for a node to exit?

A: The cost of exiting ExinPool is 0.2%, and it supports EPC deduction, which means you can exit with no service fee.

> Q: What does the revenue include?

A: Node revenue includes basic revenue and MEV revenue. The basic revenue is the node reward of The Beacon Chain, and maximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block. MEV revenue is random (the node that obtains MEV revenue is random, and the number of MEV revenue is random). A detailed description of MEV can be found [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/).

> Q: When will the node revenue be paid?

A: The basic revenue and MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) revenue are combined and distributed daily.

At present, the Shanghai upgrade has been completed, and eETH can be exchanged for ETH or other currencies at [@7000101276](https://mixin.one/codes/310e1f2b-2fc7-4ae0-ae2c-2f4c189808b1), and the revenue of ETH nodes will continue to be distributed in eETH in the future.

ExinPool will take a snapshot at 8:00 a.m. Beijing time, and earnings will generally be released after 15:00. In addition, it should be noted that it is normal for the earnings to be distributed before 24:00 on the day of sending. If there are any changes, please refer to the announcement.

> Q: What is eETH?

A: In " When will the node revenue be paid", it is mentioned that the revenue will be distributed using eETH. The relationship between eETH and ETH is 1:1. Currently, Mixin Wallet can view the price, which is the same as ETH. At present, the Shanghai upgrade has been completed, and eETH can be exchanged for ETH or other currencies at [@7000101276](https://mixin.one/codes/310e1f2b-2fc7-4ae0-ae2c-2f4c189808b1), and the revenue of ETH nodes will continue to be distributed in eETH in the future.

> Q: Where will the node revenue be paid?

A：Uniformly paid to Mixin wallet.

> Q: Are the revenue automatically reinvested?

A: No, although ETH and eETH have the same value, they are two different coins in the Mixin Network, and the received eETH does not support reinvestment to the ETH node. If you want to reinvest, you need to queue up with ETH, and you will only get revenue after joining successfully. If you want to reinvest, you can convert eETH to ETH at [@7000101276](https://mixin.one/codes/310e1f2b-2fc7-4ae0-ae2c-2f4c189808b1) and queue up to join.

> Q: Why does the node revenue keep changing every week?

A: There are the following reasons for the change of node revenue. First, the number of Ethereum 2.0 nodes is constantly changing, and the revenue is also changing; second, Ethereum 2.0 nodes currently has MEV Boost enabled, and the revenue is also changing.

> Q: If there are any other questions.

A: If you have any other questions, please leave a message for the ExinPool robot ([7000101761](https://mixin.one/codes/791f20db-51ce-4af2-918b-7496864ab833
