> Q: When will the revenue be paid?

A: Revenue and rewards are sent every 14 days. This is because the minimum pledge for an Avalanche node is 14 days and the revenue will be returned with the pledge and revenue after the pledge ends. ExinPool will take a snapshot at 8am BST each day and the revenue will be released 14 days after the join is successful and effective.

**Important Note**: If you need to exit, remember to exit after the revenue are released. If you exit before 8am on the day the revenue are released, there will be no data in the snapshot, and even if you successfully join and the node generates revenue, the successfully joined shares will not generate revenue.
