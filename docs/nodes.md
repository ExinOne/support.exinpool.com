## Mixin Network

Mixin is a free, lightning-fast, peer-to-peer, cross-chain transactional network for digital assets, which enables other blockchain distributed ledgers to gain high TPS, sub-second confirmations, zero transaction fee, enhanced privacy, and limitless extensibility.

Mixin Network is a decentralized network based on PoS consensus. Full nodes use XIN as collateral. The XIN collateralized each year is 2% of the circulation. The first year is 10,000 XIN, and the second year 11,000 XIN, and so on. As long as there are enough mortgage tokens, anyone can apply and anonymously join the Mixin mainnet without any permission.

## Ethereum

The Beacon Chain was the name of the original proof-of-stake blockchain that was launched in 2020. It was created to ensure the proof-of-stake consensus logic was sound and sustainable before enabling it on Ethereum Mainnet. Therefore, it ran alongside the original proof-of-work Ethereum. Switching off proof-of-work and switching on proof-of-stake on Ethereum required instructing the Beacon Chain to accept transactions from the original Ethereum chain, bundle them into blocks and then organize them into a blockchain using a proof-of-stake based consensus mechanism. At the same moment, the original Ethereum clients turned off their mining, block propagation and consensus logic, handing that all over to the Beacon Chain. This event was known as The Merge. Once The Merge happened, there were no longer two blockchains; there was just one proof-of-stake Ethereum chain.


## Axie Infinity

Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players. Inspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle, and trade token-based creatures known as Axies.

## Solana

Founded by former Qualcomm, Intel, and Dropbox engineers in late-2017, Solana is a single-chain, delegated-Proof-of-Stake protocol whose focus is on delivering scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. Core to Solana's scaling solution is a decentralized clock titled Proof-of-History (PoH), built to solve the problem of time in distributed networks in where there is not a single, trusted, source of time. By using Verifiable Delay Functions, PoH allows each node to locally generate timestamps with SHA256 computations. This eliminates the need for the broadcasts of timestamps across the network, improving overall network efficiency. Solana’s mission is to support all high-growth and high-frequency blockchain applications, and to democratize the world’s financial systems.





## Polkadot

Polkadot is a sharded, multi-chain network that aims to eliminate the fragmentation seen in the blockchain industry today. The network's native asset, DOT, is used to incentivize participation in consensus, as a medium of exchange and within Polkadot's governance system.

Some of the earliest blockchains remain largely isolated from one another and add blocks sequentially. This creates bottlenecks and congestion, resulting in slower transaction speeds. Polkadot seeks to address this by processing blocks in parallel.

The sharded chains that connect to Polkadot are known as parachains. According to the project's documentation, developers can customize parachains, optimizing them for specific use cases, through the Substrate framework.
